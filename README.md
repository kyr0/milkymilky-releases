## MilkyMilky Releases

MilkyMilky is a music visualizer that is able to make pixels dance to the music you play on your computer.

The original algorithms have been implemented by Ryan Geiss together with preset developers, who volunteered
in creating those for the Winamp music visualization extension called Milkdrop.

Later on, Jordan Berg re-implemented the renderer with preset support for the modern web platform using
WebGL and WebAssembly.

Finally, Aron Homberg, implemented a modern cross-platform native bridge so that all of this would simply
run on any Windows, macOS and Linux machine.

Now, finally, we can all enjoy the best and most beautiful artistic music visualizations on our computers,
no matter what app we use for playback.
